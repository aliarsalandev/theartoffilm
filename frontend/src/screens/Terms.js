                    If you cancel your contract with us and goods have already
                    been sent to you, then you must return the goods to us as
                    soon as possible after informing us of your decision to
                    cancel. You will be responsible for the cost of returning
                    the goods. We will not be responsible for any damage or loss
                    to the goods that occurs before they are returned to us,
                    including while the goods are in transit.

                <p>
                  If you cancel your contract with us, we will reimburse to you
                  all payments we received from you under the contract,
                  including the costs of delivery, except for any supplementary
                  delivery charges resulting from your choice of a delivery type
                  other than the least expensive type of standard delivery that
                  we offer. Please note that we are permitted by law to reduce
                  your reimbursement to reflect any reduction in the value of
                  the goods that was caused by handling other than what is
                  necessary to establish the nature, characteristics, and
                  functioning of the goods.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We will provide the reimbursement without undue delay and no
                  later than the earlier of 14 days after we receive back from
                  you any goods supplied or 14 days after you provide proof that
                  you have returned the goods. If no goods were supplied, then
                  we will provide the reimbursement no later than 14 days after
                  the day we were informed of your decision to cancel.

                  If you requested the performance of services begin during the
                  cancellation period, you are required to pay us an amount
                  which is in proportion to what has been performed until you
                  have communicated to us your decision to cancel this contract.
                  We will reimburse to you any amount you have paid above this
                  proportionate payment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We will make the reimbursement using the same form of payment
                  as you used for the initial purchase unless you have expressly
                  agreed otherwise. You will not incur any fees because of the
                  reimbursement.
